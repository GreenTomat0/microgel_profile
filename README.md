# Density Profile Analysis of a Microgel

This project performs a density profile analysis of a microgel sample, with data acquired through confocal microscopy. The analysis includes image preprocessing, extraction of 2D and 3D density profiles, and visualization of density distributions.

Preprocessing with ImageJ includes:
<ul>
<li>Noise reduction and contrast adjustment</li>
<li>Extraction of x, y, and color intensity information from the image.</li>
</ul>

2D and 3D density profiles were then calculated in Python
Data files with "x, y (slice) color" are here --> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OzDcylFHByDObs30-sLy-e9nZR6wJhIG?usp=sharing
